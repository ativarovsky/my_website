Hi there. I'm Alice and I'm glad you stopped by.

I'm an Epidemiologist and R enthusiast, currently based in Los Angeles. I created this blog to explore public health topics using R, practice coding, data analysis, and scientific communication skills, showcase projects, and document useful tidbits I learned along the way. 

Please refer to this [post](https://www.alicetivarovsky.com/blog/2020-07-06-hello-blog-world/) for more details on why and how this blog exists, and for more on my background, check out the [About](/about/) page.

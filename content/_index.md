Hi there. I'm Alice and I'm glad you stopped by.

I'm an Epidemiologist, and I created this blog to explore my interest in the intersection of data science and health. Using publicly available datasets, I contribute projects spanning the areas of biostatistics, epidemiology, data visualization, and all kinds of other fun things.

For more about my background, check out the [About](/about/) page.

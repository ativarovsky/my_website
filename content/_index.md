Hi there. I'm Alice and I'm glad you stopped by.

I'm an Epidemiologist and R enthusiast, and I created this blog to explore the intersection of these two things. Using publicly available datasets, I contribute projects spanning the areas of biostatistics, epidemiology, data visualization, and all kinds of other fun things. I also document useful insights both inside and outside the world of R. 

Please refer to this [post](https://www.alicetivarovsky.com/blog/2020-07-06-hello-blog-world/) for more details on why and how this blog exists, and for more about my background, check out the [About](/about/) page.

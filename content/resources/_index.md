As I've spent more time in R, I've come to realize the value of a repository of good resources to refer back to when I'm solving a problem. The following is my (growing) list of books and posts I've come back to over the years. 

### Data Science, Programming & R
- I refer back to Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund's [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html) at work and for this blog all the time. As impressed as I was by the text as a master's student, I am even more impressed by how comprehensive and helpful it is in the "real world". 
- [RStudio Cheatsheets](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/) are great for quick reference for most major packages. 
- [R-bloggers](https://www.r-bloggers.com/) is a great way to keep up with what's going on and learn from other R users.
- Even if computer science is not directly in your domain, [Harvard's CS50 on edX](https://pll.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science?delta=0) is eye-opening. 
- If you're a beginner and want to get your feet wet and start to develop some muscle memory, [DataCamp](https://app.datacamp.com/learn) has some nice courses. I personally think investing time in actual projects is more bang for your buck, but sometimes you just want to do a few coding exercises.  
- If you're doing any kind of data work in R, chances are you'll want to make tables. Don't settle for sub-par looking tables. Use the `kableExtra` [package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/kableExtra/vignettes/awesome_table_in_html.html).  
- This is more specific to public health, but T[he Epidemiologist R Handbook](https://epirhandbook.com/en/) is a great reference. 

### Statistics
- If you're looking for something not too technical, or you're just starting out, [Discovering Statistics Using R](https://www.amazon.com/Discovering-Statistics-Using-Andy-Field/dp/1446200469) is a highly accessible (and often funny) text to work through. 
- If you're specifically interested in Biostatistics, [Fundamentals of Biostatistics](https://www.amazon.com/Fundamentals-Biostatistics-Bernard-Rosner/dp/130526892X/ref=sr_1_1?crid=37RU4JVY85J12&keywords=fundamentals+of+biostatistics&qid=1666305960&qu=eyJxc2MiOiIxLjI1IiwicXNhIjoiMS4wNCIsInFzcCI6IjEuMzEifQ%3D%3D&s=books&sprefix=fundamentals+of+biostatistic%2Cstripbooks%2C554&sr=1-1) is essential reading. 

### Blogging & Hugo
- [Creating Websites with R Markdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) is incredibly accessible to beginners and should be a prerequisite for using `blogdown`. 
- Hugo has a huge [repository](https://gohugo.io/documentation/) of documents and I've been able to answer a lot of my more detailed questions by just typing keywords into the search bar.

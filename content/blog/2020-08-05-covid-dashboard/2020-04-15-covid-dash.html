<p>For those following the Covid-19 trajectories, this <code>flexdashboard</code> is not a novel concept (pun not intended). <a href="/assets/covid_dash.html">My version</a> is adapted from Rami Krispinâ€™s <a href="https://ramikrispin.github.io/coronavirus_dashboard/">original</a> and uses his <code>coronavirus</code> package.</p>

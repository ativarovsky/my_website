Below is a snapshot of my career thus far. The journey has been, shall we say, non-linear. But good stories always have some plot twists and turns. Today, I feel fortunate to work in a highly visible field, where I get to play with data, help policy-makers make decisions, and, with hope, leave a positive impact in the community.
